# 🌍 EcoScan - Clothing Carbon Footprint Scanner

## 📜 Overview
EcoScan is a web application designed to help users understand the environmental impact of their clothing. By uploading or capturing images of clothing items, users can see estimated carbon scores, earn eco-reward points, and redeem sustainability-focused offers. This project is a full-stack solution aimed at promoting sustainable practices.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript
- **Image Recognition**: Mock image analysis for development; integration-ready for AI/ML-based APIs.

## 🌱 Carbon Score Assumptions

To calculate the environmental impact of each clothing item, we have assigned approximate carbon scores based on item type. These scores are stored in an in-memory dictionary for quick access.

| 👕 Item       | 🌍 Estimated Carbon Score (kg CO₂) |
|---------------|------------------------------------|
| T-shirt       |   5                                |
| Jeans         |   10                               |
| Sweater       |   7                                |
| Jacket        |   15                               |
| Socks         |   2                                |
| Shoes         |   12                               |
| Scarf         |   4                                |
| Hat           |   3                                |
